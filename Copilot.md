# Microsoft Copilot Studio - No Code / Low Code Development

[Microsoft Copilot Studio ![external link](/content/imgs/external_link.png)](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio)  is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering that enables the development of AI-powered virtual agents and bots using a no-code/low-code approach. It provides a visual interface for building and deploying virtual agents that can be seamlessly integrated with existing applications and services.

> Please note that you may come across documentation referring to Power Virtual Agent instead of Microsoft Copilot Studio. It's important to highlight that Power Virtual Agent is the previous name for Microsoft Copilot Studio.

Copilot Studio is built on top of Power Virtual Agents, which is a low-code/no-code platform specifically designed for creating chatbots and virtual agents. By leveraging Copilot Studio, customers can benefit from its deep integration with Microsoft services, allowing easy access to data from various sources and formats.

While Copilot Studio offers significant value, it does require some learning curve, particularly in adopting DevOps practices. However, as part of the Power Platform family, Copilot Studio inherits features such as common user management, application lifecycle management (ALM) practices, data loss prevention, and security features. So people with Power Platform experience can quickly start using Copilot Studio.
